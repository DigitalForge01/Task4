Summary
Firewalls act like gatekeepers—examining, evaluating, and enforcing rules on network traffic. Depending on their sophistication, they can filter based solely on packet headers, maintain session context, or even analyze packet content deep into the application layer. Whether in consumer systems like Windows Defender Firewall or enterprise-grade next-gen firewalls, the end goal is the same: allowing legitimate traffic while blocking threats.
